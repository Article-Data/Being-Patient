<h1 style="color:Black; font-size:70px; text-align:center;"> <u> Being Patient </u> </h1>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u>Synopsis:</u> This is a story of a woman who was patient when everything went of the hand!</b><br><br></p>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:20px;"> <b> Note: The names have been removed for privacy reasons.</b> </p> <br> <br>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> I saw a pretty woman while I was walking on the streets, The woman was shining in her beauty. I looked at her and said,<br>
    "By God, this beauty and fine complexion must surely be, because she never experienced any grief or sorrow! </p>
	
<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> When I said this she overheard me and said: "Sir, it is that what you think?"
By God, I am bent down under all the sorrows and grief that have come my way! My heart and mind is filled with so
    much grief and all along there has been no one who share these with me! </p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> I asked: "And how is that, lady?" </p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> She replied: My husband once slaughter a goat as an offering, while i was feeding my infant child. My two young sons
were playing around me. When i went to cook the meat, One of the son said to the other: "Come, Let me show you how our father has slaughtered the goat." The
other son said: "Well show me." The first one then made the second one lie down and cut his throat, same like his father had slaughtered the goat.<br>
When he realized what had happened, he ran away into the mountains, where he was attacked by a wolf and got eaten up!<br>
My husband went in search for him; searching him from place to place until he died too out of extreme thirst!<br>
In the mean time, I was at home frantic with worry waiting for the news of him. I had put down my infant child and went to the door to inquire about anyone
who might have news of my husband. My infant child crawled to the fireplace where a pot was boiling. He touched it and the boiling pot fell upon the baby,
burning it to death in such a ghastly manner that the child's meat became separated from the bones!<br>
When my married daughter heard all of this in the house of her husband, she fell down of shock. Thus i was left alone to bear all that!<br><br>
I asked her: "And how did you manage all these misfortunes with?" <br><br>
She replied: "Whoever ponders on the difference between patience and impatience, finds a world of difference between the two. The reward of being patient is
praiseworthy; whereas for impatience there is nothing!" <br>
She recited some lines of poetry before walking away: <br> </p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px; text-align:center;"> 
<i> Patience did i exercise, <br>
For that was my strongest pillar! <br>
And should impatience have helped, <br>
Then i would have tried her. <br>
Such patience i did have on that; <br>
Had my trails descended on mountain high, <br>
In broken rocks they would have ended! <br>
Indeed did i control my eyes, <br>
Those tears did not fall; <br>
And now within my heart alone, <br>
My tears do roll..... </i> </p> <br>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> <b> What did you learn from this story? </b> </p>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:25px;"> No matter what the situation is, It doesn't matter what you are going through!<br>
Crying is a human nature and i am not stopping you from crying. If you cry, your heart becomes light, the burden goes away.<br>
But the worst part is Howling and stopping at the same place! <br>
Life doesn't stop if you stop eating, thinking about all the worst which you went through! <br>
Remember, "Everything happens for a reason" <br>
So if you went through such situation or you are a broken heart, Please get back on the track! <br>
The people who left you are already enjoying their life, why would you ruin yours? Especially the teenagers. <br>
If you think you can't live without her or If you think you cannot live without him, Think of your parents! <br>
They nurtured you right from the day you were born! <br>
A father gives up on his dreams to fulfill yours, <br>
Whereas A mother keeps praying and takes cares of all her children. She divides her love equally to all her kids. Even if you become a 60 year old,
You are still a kid to your parents! <br>
Set a goal in your life, be content and thankful for whatever you have in your life. If you have a House to Live, Food to Eat, Bed to sleep, Parents
to take care, You are the luckiest person in the whole world! <br>
There are 200 Million homeless people around the world! They dont have a house to live! Think about them what they are going through! <br>
140 Million orphans in the whole world! Think about them, They dont have parents to take care of them, No one to love them? Just think!<br>
There is a difference between a NEED and a WISH! Zarurat aur Khwahish ke beech mai bohot fark hai! <br>
House, Food, Spouse, Parents, Kids these are needy things. You cannot live without anyone of them! <br>
Each and every person on this planet has tensions according to their situation. Be grateful for what you have and you will be the happiest person in
the world! </p> <br> 

<p style="color:Black; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> "<u>AFTER EVERY HARDSHIP, THERE COMES EASE!</u>" </p> <br>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> <i> When you go through the hardships and then reach your destination only then you can find peace!
Because you know how hard the path is and when you reach safely you will be humble and kind coz you dont want anyone else to go through such pain!</i></p><br><br>
